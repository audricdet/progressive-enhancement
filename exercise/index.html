            <p id="p1">Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or
                that gaz
                opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no
                such
                thing as an issue.
                <br>
                Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
                Nothing
                exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
                changes.
                That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
                translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on
                that
                way.
                Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.
                <br>
                They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself
                out of
                that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But
                the
                person
                is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make
                your
                world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

            <h2>The story</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/horse-S0A0PBw8pZNFC"
                    target="_blank"><span title="gif of a horse">horse</span></a> ran away. That evening, all of his
                neighbors
                came around
                to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is
                    most unfortunate.</q> The
                farmer said, <q class="farmer">Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>?
                    I
                    don't know.</q>The next
                day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses
                with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky.
                    What a
                    great turn of events.
                    You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">Is it <span
                        class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.</q>

                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
                his
                leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q>
                and
                the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Is
                    it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I
                    don't know.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the
                army,
                and they
                rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q
                    class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q>
                Again, he said, <q class="farmer">Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span
                        class="bad">bad</span>?
                    I don't know.</q>

                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible
                to
                tell
                whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> —
                because
                you never know what will be the consequence of the
                misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for <a
